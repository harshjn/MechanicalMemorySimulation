In this file, we look at the generation of mechanical memory in frictional contacts in a collapsed hexagonal mesh in two-dimensions. The mesh is constrained in 2D. The volume and surface mesh files for the hexagonal mesh are vol.msh and surf.msh respectively. These mesh files were generated via gmsh.
